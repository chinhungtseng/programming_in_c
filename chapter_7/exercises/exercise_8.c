 * 8. An equation of the form
 *    
 *    ax^2 + bx + c = 0
 *    
 *    is know as a quadratic equation. The values of a, b, c in the preceding 
 *    example represent constant values. So
 *    
 *    4x^2 - 17x - 15 = 0
 *    
 *    represents a quadratic equation where a = 4, b = -17, and c = -15.
 *    The values of x that satisfy a particular quadratic equation, 
 *    known as the roots of the equation, can be calcualted by substituting
 *    the values of a, b, and c into the following two formulas:
 *    
 *    x = ( -b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ) / 2a
 *    
 *    If the value of b^2 - 4ac, called the discriminant, is less than zero,
 *    the roots of the equation, x1 and x2, are imaginary numbers.
 *    
 *    Write a program to solve a quadratic equation. The program should allow
 *    the user to enter the values for a, b, and c. If the discriminant is 
 *    less than zero, a message should be displayed that the roots are imaginary;
 *    otherwise, the program should then proceed to calculate and display the 
 *    tow roots of the equation.
 *    (Note: Be certain to make use of the squareRoot() function that you 
 *    developed in this chapter.)
 *    
 *    Note:
 *    * What is discriminant? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMLxzZAjQAs
